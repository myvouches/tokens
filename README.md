Hi there,

We recently discovered a bug in how we store the proof of your vouches. As a precaution, we'll be **revoking all your bot tokens** by posting them publicly on GitHub.

To keep your bot running smoothly, please **reset your token** and update it on your dashboard. You can reset your token [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

We apologize for the inconvenience, and as a gesture of goodwill, we'll be **adding 7 extra days** to all active subscriptions.

Thanks for your understanding!
